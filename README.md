# Social Library

Social Library is a web application  for managing and sharing collections.

Who hasn't a collection? Of any sort. A book collection, a DVD collection, a CD collection, a coins collection...

Did you never accounter such situations:
- you are at a book shop. You are interested in a book you have in your hand but there is THE question: "Do I have it already or not?".
- you a looking for CD in shelves. You don't find it. The questions that come to your mind are :" Did I lost it?", "Did I lent it to someone?" and then follows those question: "Who did I lent it and when?"

This application is meant to resolve those problems.
